Frequent discord. &lt;/b&gt;Internal/external stressors are present, and household is consistently experiencing increased disruption of positive interactions coupled with lack of cooperation and/or emotional/verbal abuse. Custody and visitation issues are characterized by frequent conflicts. Caregiver's pattern of adult relationships creates significant stress for the child. Adult relationships are characterized by occasional physical outbursts that do not result in injuries and/or controlling behavior that results in isolation or restriction of activities. Both perpetrator and victim seek help in reducing threats of violence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;d. Chronic discord. &lt;/b&gt;Internal/external stressors are present, and household experiences minimal or no positive interactions. Custody and visitation issues are characterized by severe conflict, such as multiple instances of malicious reports to law enforcement and/or CPS. Caregiver's pattern of adult relationships place the child at risk for maltreatment and/or contribute to severe emotional distress. One or more household members use regular and/or severe physical violence. Individuals engage in physically assaultive behaviors toward household members. Violent or controlling behavior has resulted in injury (i.e., bruises, cuts, burns, welts, broken bones, etc.).</help-text>
