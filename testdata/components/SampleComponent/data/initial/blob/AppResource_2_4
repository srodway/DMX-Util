contrib.id=You might be expected to pay a contribution towards any services you might get. You will be assessed to make sure that any contribution you might be asked to make is no more than you can afford. When we contact you to discuss this self assessment, we will explain how charging might apply to you. We can also arrange for you to have a welfare benefits check to make sure you are getting all the benefits you are entitled to.
