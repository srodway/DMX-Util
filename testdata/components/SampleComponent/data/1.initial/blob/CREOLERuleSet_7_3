  Interface rule classes for the interaction between the CREOLE-based Assessment
  Engine and CREOLE rules for the display of  timelines of key data about the case.
  
  The rule classes for a CREOLE-based product must extend the rule classes in
  this rule set, BUT NOTE that product rule classes should not extend these
  rule classes directly - instead rule set developers for CREOLE-based products
  should extend the default implementations in the
  DefaultProductKeyDataRuleSet rule set.  These default implementations
  provide some isolation against future changes to the
  ProductKeyDataRuleSet rule classes in this rule set. 
         
  Customer code must not create, modify or remove instances of any of the rule
  classes in this rule set.  Instances of these rule classes may only be
  manipulated by the Curam Assessment Engine.

    <!-- The date of the event.
    
         Note that an event with a null date is not displayed.  This feature can be useful in situations where a null date indicates
         that no event has occurred, and will prevent the need for rules logic around whether to create the event.
         
         For example, if a person's date of death is recorded as null, then that person is still alive and thus there has been no
         "deceased" event for that person.  It is safe to create an event nonetheless, with the date of the event recorded as null.
