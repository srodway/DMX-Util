  Interface rule classes for the interaction between the CREOLE-based Assessment
  Engine and CREOLE rules for the details explaining a case's
  eligibility and entitlement decision.
  
  The rule classes for a CREOLE-based product must extend the rule classes in
  this rule set, BUT NOTE that product rule classes should not extend these
  rule classes directly - instead rule set developers for CREOLE-based products
  should extend the default implementations in the
  DefaultProductDecisionDetailsRuleSet rule set.  These default implementations provide
  some isolation against future changes to the ProductDecisionDetailsRuleSet rule
  classes in this rule set. 
  
  Customer code must not create, modify or remove instances of any of the rule
  classes in this rule set.  Instances of these rule classes may only be
  manipulated by the Curam Assessment Engine.
