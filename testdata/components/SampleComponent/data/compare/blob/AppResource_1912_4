QuestionPage.AssessmentDetails.Title=SDM\u00AE Risk Reassessment
NewDisplayTextID=<p style="font-family:tahoma;font-size:12px;color:#4e4e4e">The Family Risk Reassessment combines items from the original Risk assessment with additional items that evaluate a family's progress toward case plan goals. Research has demonstrated that for the reassessment, a single index best categorizes risk for future maltreatment. Therefore, the Risk Reassessment is comprised of a single index, as opposed to the initial Risk Assessment, which has separate indices for abuse and neglect.</p>

Question.Label.R2=R2. Household has previously received CPS (voluntary/ court ordered)
